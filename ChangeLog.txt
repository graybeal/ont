ChangeLog

2010-06-17   1.9.4.alpha
	#158: "Mechanism for tracking accesses to ontologies/terms"
	Preliminary preparations using Google analytics:
	- Asynchronous snippet inserted at the bottom of the <head> section in sparql.html.
	  See ORR's ChangeLog.txt

2010-06-16   1.9.3.alpha
	Issue #252: "omv:version gone?".
	- Fix completed.
	- Note: as part of the fix, OntServlet now also calls _dispatchUri() where
	  the old dispatching mechanism was in place. This goes toward unifying various
	  refactoring attemtps. A consequence of this is that content negotiation is now
	  honored where it was not previously. For Firefox in particular, a request with 
	  no explicit format (via file extension or 'form' parameter) will resolve to "html"
	  thus causing a redirection to the ORR portal. Previously this would resolve in 
	  the "owl" response. 
	- Various adjustments to properly dispatch a regular file after the normal URI 
	  resolution steps fail.


2010-06-15   1.9.2.alpha   (note: syncing version with iserver and orr modules)
	Issue #252: "omv:version gone?".
	- In general, the solution is to obtain a synthetic omv.version value taken from omv.creationDate value.
	- Methods created as part of the fix:
		- JenaUtil2.getVersionFromCreationDate(OntModel model)
		- JenaUtil2.setVersionFromCreationDateIfNecessary(OntModel ontModel)
	  Called by:
	  	- UnversionedConverter: to take care of adding omv.version to the unversioned response
	  	- UriResolver2: for cases where UnversionedConverter is not used.
	  	
	- Note that the solution above is to take care of already registered ontologies that are missing
	  the omv.version property. The iserver module also has a corresponding fix so new submissions 
	  now will have this property assigned.
	  
	  
	
2010-06-14   1.7.0.beta3
	Issue #242: "admin interface to remove an ontology" implemented:
	- OntConfig: new BIOPORTAL_REST_URL property similar to the one in ontmd2 module, ie.,
	  URL of the "aquaportal" REST endpoint. Keeping the prefix "bioportal" because that's the
	  one used in ontmd2 (so it's easier to track-- TODO: general clean-up).
	  
	- New OntologyDeleter for the basic removal from the bioportal back-end
	
	- OntServlet._unregisterOntology: calls the above and also updates the graphs resource
	  and the triple store.
	
	- Moved getRegisteredOntologyLatestVersion(String potentialOntUri) from OntServlet to Db.
	
	- New org.mmisw.ont.vocabulary.Rdfg for definitions in http://www.w3.org/2004/03/trix/rdfg-1/
	
	Update of new graphs:
	- Note: The graphs resource (<internal-dir>/graphs.rdf) was not updated upon regular submission
	  of a new ontology. That is, the following statement was not added to it:
	     <new ontology URI> rdf:type <rdfg:Graph>. 
	  This is done now, see call to adminDispatcher.newGraph(ownGraphUri) in OntGraphAG._loadOntology.
	  Prior to this change, the following query:
			PREFIX rdfg: <http://www.w3.org/2004/03/trix/rdfg-1/>
			PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
			SELECT ?graph 
			WHERE { ?graph rdf:type rdfg:Graph }
	  returned only a couple of solutions corresponding to previous tests with the direct registration 
	  mechanism, which was the only method passing non-null value for the graphId, thus triggering the 
	  whole addition of graph-related statements.
	  
	

2010-05-23   1.7.0.beta2
	- Issue #243 fixed.
	  UnversionedConverter: omv:version obtained from the model itself with a new utility
	  in JenaUtil2. Also, exactly the value (if any) is put in the unversioned result.
	  
2010-04-28   1.7.0.beta1
	- continuing unregistration of ontology ...

2010-04-28
	Re-writing of Graphviz dot format generation moved to new module
	org.mmisw.ont2dot
	TODO: remove DotGenerator class and update dispatcher to use the new module.
	
	
	
2010-04-05   1.7.0.beta1
	- Removal of an ontology ...
	
	
2009-12-29   1.6.0.beta3
	- NOTE about AllegroGraph bugs. See OntGraphAG._executeQuery:
	  1) SPARQLQuery.run throws an exception! Documentation in this regard is very little. So, I'm
	     calling the other methods to execute the various query flavors.
	  2) the AG serializers are not working (not even in the examples provided by them). So, I'm
	  creating a jena Model from the results and then using the jena serializer.
	  TODO: this is already working for some of the requests but needs to be completed.
	  Examples:
	     http://localhost:8080/ont?uri=http://example.org/test1/termThree&form=n3
	     http://localhost:8080/ont?uri=http://example.org/test1/termThree&form=owl
	     http://localhost:8080/ont?uri=http://example.org/test1/termThree&form=rdf
	     http://localhost:8080/ont?uri=http://example.org/test1/termThree&form=csv
	     http://localhost:8080/ont?uri=http://example.org/test1/termThree&form=html
	  NOTE that this functionality is particularly for terms (not for whole ontologies)
	  
	
2009-12-28   1.6.0.beta3
	- OntGraphAG: removed unused code.
	- new AdminDispatcher: helper for OntServlet
	
	Processing the association of user-specified named graphs:
	
	- IOntGraph.loadOntology(ontology, graphId): now with the graphId parameter.
	  Only processed by the OntGraphAG implementation.
	
	- new build property ont.internal.dir (/Users/Shared/mmiregistry/internal) to store some internal
	  resources, currently the graphs.rdf file, which is used to store the user-specified graphs
	  following the RDFG vocabulary (http://www.w3.org/2004/03/trix/rdfg-1)
	  
	- AdminDispatcher: besides the SKOS-related statments for inference, the supporting statements also
	  include a statement for the transitive property of rdfg:subGraphOf (not tested yet).
	  
	- OntGraphAG._loadOntology: the graphId (if given) is converted to a "well-formed" URI in case it matches
	  a simple fragment:
	     graphUri = OntConfig.Prop.ONT_SERVICE_URL.getValue() + "/mmiorr-internal/graphs/ + graphId
	  For example, if graphId=="ooi-ci", then the resulting URI of the graph is
	     http://mmisw.org/ont/mmiorr-internal/graphs/ooi-ci
	  in the case of the MMI deployment.
	  
	  Note that all statements of a registered ontology with URI <ouri> are loaded in the graph with the same 
	  URI <ouri> in the triple store (using the context parameter in the AG APIs).
	  When the user specifies a desired <graphUri> for the ontology, the graph identified
	  by <ouri> is made a subClassOf the graph identified by <graphUri>.
	  See OntGraphAG._addSubGraph.
	  
	
	
2009-12-24   1.6.0.beta2
	- OntServlet._getUsersRdf: adjustments. Versioned URIs (using current time). Empty prefix associated with
	  the versioned URI.
	
2009-12-23   1.6.0.beta1
	Preparing for handling "internal" ontologies. An internal ontology provides supporting information
	for the MMI ORR. 

	- OntServlet._getUsersRdf: "_usrsrdf": outputs the list of registered users in RDF/XML format.
	

2009-12-18   1.5.0.beta5
	- OntGraphAG.loadOntology: load ontology and lauch indexing of new triples
	- OntGraphAG._loadOntology: remove all statements associated with the graph before
	  parsing the new contents.
	- OntGraphAG.init: report (log.info): index flavors, unindexed threshold, unindexed triples, total triples.
	  Note: no action is taken if the reported unindexed triples is > 0 at init time; this is because:
	  	- reinit always reindexes all triples
	  	- loadOntology indexes the new triples
	  Normally, unindexed triples at init time should be zero.
	  
	  NOTE: the setUnindexedThreshold is not yet used, so no automatic reindexing of the triple store is enabled. 
	  

2009-12-18   1.5.0.beta4
	Have been looking at other possible triple stores (Open Anzo, 4store, sesame, TDB, ...)
	
2009-12-18   1.5.0.beta4
	- org.mmisw.ont.graph.allegro: new package for AG related types
	- org.mmisw.ont.graph.mem: new package for the previous memory based model
	
	- OntGraphAG.init(): populates triple store and also indexes it.
	
	Fortunately, no strange behavior on the MMIWEB deployment. 
	Here are some stats:
	
	Reload (http://mmisw.org/ont/?_reload):
		- 140 ontologies to be loaded
		- triple store populated in 1:10.706 minutes:seconds  
		- #triples= 92651
		- indexing completed in 11.015 seconds
		
	Query involving inference:
		PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos#>
		PREFIX vocres: <http://mmisw.org/ont/testing/vocres/>
		SELECT ?o WHERE {vocres:a skos:exactMatch ?o. }
	Processed in 1.35 seconds:  (see http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=175)
		http://mmisw.org/ont/testing/vocres/b
		http://mmisw.org/ont/testing/vocres/d
		http://mmisw.org/ont/testing/vocres/c
		
	(the same query took 12 seconds before indexing).
	
	

2009-12-17   1.5.0.beta4
	*** Continuing enabling AllegroGraph as persistent triple store ***
	- Enabling association of named graphs
	- OntGraphAG._loadOntology:
		- ontologyUri used as graph name for the ontology
	- Argh!: tests of this on my local AG installation caused some very weird behavior!
	  - at some point I got the "exceeded 50 million triple limit"! (my local repository
	    is less than 30K triples!)
	  - query performance really bad! actually it may be not working at all (even though that
	    'top' shows me >99% cpu usage!
	  - however, the deployment at MMIWEB seems to be working fine.
	  
	
2009-12-16   1.5.0.beta3
	*** Continuing enabling AllegroGraph as persistent triple store ***
	- enabling direct SPARQL query dispatch with AllegroGraph so reasoning can be enabled.
	- unfortunately, AG serializers are not working ...
	- TODO: query dispatch according to desired format needs more work and clean-up!
	 

2009-12-14   1.5.0.beta2
	*** Continuing enabling AllegroGraph as persistent triple store ***
	- Re-enabling inferences (issue #175 Enable inference mechanism)
	- OntGraphAG.doReInitModel: 
		- load the skos properties model, inf_properties.nt (N-triples format required)
	- OntGraphAG.executeQuery: 
		- creates a Jena inference model on the fly using inf_rules.txt as in OntGraphMem.
		  TODO: there is perhaps a mechanism to encode the rules in the triple store
		         so it's not necessary to associate them every time a query is issued.
		- NOTE: although the inference model creation takes a fraction of a second (in my test
		  environment), a query involving the inference rules seems rather slow, 15 secs:
			PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2008/05/skos#>
			PREFIX vocres: <http://localhost:8080/ont/mmitest/vocres/>
			SELECT ?o WHERE {vocres:a skos:exactMatch ?o. }
			
	NOTE: DISABLING THE JENA INFERENCE MODEL: makes query processing TOO slow!!
		  
	

2009-12-12   1.5.0.beta1
	*** Continuing enabling AllegroGraph as persistent triple store ***
	- IOntGraph: removed getModel; added executeQuery
	- OntGraphAG: each major operation opens/uses/closes a connection
	- sample.build.properties, OntConfig: Parameters:
		agraph.host - server host
		agraph.port - server port
		agraph.ts.dir  - base dir for triple stores
		agraph.ts.name - name of main triple store
	- IOntGraph.Factory removed (replaced by the OntGraph proxy as follows)
	- New OntGraph as a proxy to the actual implementation. In particular, init(), which is called
	  after the config info is available, does the actual instantiation. If the config parameter 
	  agraph.host is given, then the AllegroGraph implementation is used; otherwise the OntGraphMem one.
	
	NOTE: query processing time seems rather slow, for example for some simple queries like:
	   select ?s ?p ?o where { ?s ?p ?o } limit 1
	Similar queries using the standalone AgWebView seem to run much faster. 
	TODO: improve performance.
	
	TODO: Enable rules for mappings as in the memory-based implementation.
	

2009-12-11   1.5.0.beta1
	*** Continuing enabling AllegroGraph as persistent triple store ***
	
	- New package org.mmisw.ont.graph with IOntGraph as common interface for the memory-based
	  implementation and the new AllegroGraph implementation.
	- IOntGraph.Factory provides the construction of the implementation. For now, the
	  selection of the implementation is hard-coded while I do the preparation and
	  tests (eventually I can enable the "old" memory-based implementation to allow the
	  commit of other unrelated changes and from there bew able to create other releases 
	  while the new AllegroGraph triple store is completed).
	- As one of the dependencies is for dispatching SPARQL queries, I extracted 
	  the QueryResult type from the Sparql class to eventually add the query dispatch 
	  operation to IOntGraph.
	  
	
2009-12-10   1.5.0.beta1

	*** Started enabling AllegroGraph as persistent triple store ***
	Just preliminary code changes
	
	- sample.build.properties, OntConfig: new parameters:
		agraph.ts.dir  - base dir for triple stores
		agraph.ts.name - name of main triple store
	- OntGraphMem.java: Copy of OntGraph.java right before the new changes, 894 11/25/09 7:43 PM 
	- included agraph.jar
	
	- OntGraph: just preliminary code for initialization of AllegroGraph
	  Next: 
	    init(): should just set up the _ts (no reinitialization as the store is persistent)
	    reinit(): should be only to reset the whole triple store -- to be called upon a
	    special call to the servlet
	    
	    getModel(): reimplementation may be via the Jena interface provide by allegroGraph
	    (haven't examined this part yet)
	
	


2009-11-24   1.4.2.beta
	Fixed Issue 223: ontology graph with all versions
	- Db.getOntologies() deprecated: the comment says "Returns the list of the latest versions..." but that
	  is not accurate; it returns all versions.
	- new method getAllOntologies(boolean allVersions) with the correct behavior.
	- Called in OntGraph._doInitModel.
	  
	
2009-11-24   1.4.1.beta
	- DotGenerator: generate instance diagram (see comments in the class).
	  TODO: eventually provide this functionality in a separate module so it's easier
	  to deploy as a standalone tool.
	
	
2009-11-18   1.4.0.beta
	Issue #222 - duplicate of issue #43: Handle non-UTF8 and UTF8 inputs
	- New OntServlet.serializeModelToOutputStream(Model model, String lang, OutputStream os), 
	  which basically fixes serializeModel(Model model, String lang) -> StringReader, that is,
	  let Jena handle the encoding of the output, which should be UTF-8 in general.
	  The problem with the former method was that it messes up the encoding.
	
	FIXME: SparqlDispatcher.execute: UTF-8 encoding especially for RDF/XML output
	
	
	Other changes:
		- OntGraph._doInitModel: continue initialization even if a model fails to be loaded. 


2009-11-10   1.3.15.beta
	- Fixed issue #218: Request to (re)load re-hosted ontology in graph fails
		- Db.getOntology(String ontologyUri): was missing an "ontology.setUri(ontologyUri);" assignment--fixed.
	
	-  Issue 219: Ability to maintain multiple graphs 
		- Reviewing OntGraph and possible mechanism to have multiple graphs.
	

2009-10-06   1.3.14.beta
	- issue #196 capture omv:reference
		Omv: added omv:reference
		
	- issue #99 Normalize theme/topic/class throughout interface
		OmvMmi: added omvmmi:hasResourceType
	
	
2009-09-30   1.3.13.beta
	- Creating org.mmisw.ont.misc.jar with common utilities that are used by other modules.
	  Currently only with JenaUtil2 (this class was temporarily replicated in iserver).
	  Except for a minor change in JenaUtil2, no other code changes.
	  

2009-09-29   1.3.12.beta
	Investigating regression issue. Test with http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/device -- it returns *versioned!*
		UnversionedConverter: enabling debug info
		
	Ok, what happened was this: I uploaded a *versioned* device ontology to create a new version in the
	registry. So the "old" (versioned) namespace got stuck in the contents. The UnversionedConverter moves
	everything in the new (versioned) namespace to the unversioned namespace but will not do
	anything to the stuff in the old (versioned) namespace. That's why I got what looks a versioned
	response from the unversioned request.
	This is definitely a potential issue. Where should it be fixed? 
		a) properly prepare the uploaded ontology so it removes the version component (if any, automatically);
		and/or
		b) in UnversionedConverter so it moves everything from related versioned namespaces to the unversioned
		namespace.
	See issue #192 "wrong versioned/unversioned response"
	
	
2009-09-18   1.3.11.beta
	- Sparql and SparqlDispatcher: catch potential runtime errors and respond an explicit message.
	  In particular, QueryFactory.create() and/or QueryExecutionFactory.create() may throw such
	  unchecked exceptions, so I put a catch-all statement. (The most likely error is a syntax error.)
	  The returned message is always text/plain starting with "ERROR:".
	   
	
	
2009-09-17   1.3.10.beta
	- fixed logo image link in sparql.html
	- SparqlDispatcher: now returns SC_BAD_REQUEST if sparql parameter value is not given.
	  (previously, a default example was dispatched, which was confusing in general). 
	
2009-09-10   1.3.9.beta
	- new "_usri" service to obtain user info given the username
	- Db.getUserInfo(String username)
	
	- Do not compute _infModel.size() -- takes time.
	
	
2009-09-09   1.3.8.beta
	Inferences enabled (issue #175 Enable inference mechanism)
	- New in WebContent/WEB-INF/classes/:
		inf_properties.n3 - to indicate properties of the skos relationships
		inf_rules.txt     - to indicate inference rules over the skos relationships above
	- OntServlet: Value of "_reload" param now examined: if empty or equals to "inf" then
	  inference is included in the OntGraph. This facilitates testing w/ and w/o inferencing.
	- OntGraph.reinit(boolean withInference): called with true by init().
	- OntGraph._createInfModel(): create the _infModel based on the inf_rules.txt
	- OntGraph.loadOntology(Ontology ontology): note that the updated model depends on whether
	  inference in enabled (ie., _infModel != null, then _infModel is the model updated; otherwise, _model).
	  
	So, at deployment time, the inference model is created by default. The size of the base model and
	the estimated size of the inference model are logged. This is a first step to examine memory
	consumption and then see if some critical situation should be handled soon.

2009-09-03   1.3.7.beta
	Issue #168: Submitted ontology not included for SPARQL query processing
	- OntGraph: new operation loadOntology(Ontology) to support addition of an ontology
	  to the graph.
	- OntServlet: now dispatches a "_lo" request to load a registered ontology into the graph,
	  ...?_lo=<uri>
	  Normally the given <uri> will be an unversioned one (for those resolved directly by the
	  "ont" service). In any case, the latest version is the one that gets loaded.
	  
	NOTE: this "_lo" service is to be used by the iserver module once a new submission has been
	completed, so the graph gets updated and then dependent actions go as expected, in particular,
	SPARQL queries.
	
	NOTE: While doing the above today, in Db I fixed a few places that retrieve the filename, which
	were still based on the path associated to the URL. These parts were kind of old code. The right 
	way to retrieve the filename is from the database itself.


2009-08-25  1.3.6.beta
	issue #148: "Need property to capture "creator/author of original source vocabulary""
	- Added OmvMmi.hasContentCreator property (http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/20081020/ontologyMetadata/hasContentCreator)
	
	Recall: the "vocabulary" library is used by other MMISW modules; rebuild it like this:
		ant voc-jar
	creates: org.mmisw.ont.vocabulary.jar
	

2009-08-14,16  1.3.5.beta
  	Issue #162: "External ontology considered to be internal"
	- New OntUtil class with method isOntResolvableUri(String uri): uses the ont.service.url
	  config parameter to determine if a given URI is resolvable by the deployed "ont" service.
	  This returns true iff uri.startsWith(value of ont.service.url parameter).
	  (there's a similar method in "iserver" module)
	  
	- OntConfig: removed Properties props member -- now, values are stored in the same enumeration.
	  


2009-08-13  1.3.4.beta
	- Fixed issue #163 Empty result returned for inexistent term using uri parameter 
	  If the URI is tried for a term or entity (as opposed to a registered ontology), 
	  and the result of the query is empty, then 404 is now returned to the client, instead of the
	  corresponding formatted empty result.
	  
	  
2009-08-11  1.3.3.beta
	- "uri=" request for an external (re-hosted) ontology, and with NO "version=" parameter 
	  should return the latest version:
	  	Db.getOntology(String ontologyUri): because on the "re-hosting" capability, the ontology URI is
	 	no longer unique in the database, ie., there may be multiple versions associated with the 
	 	same ontology URI. Now, this method returns the most recent version associated
	 	with the given URI.
	 	This fixes the issue in general.
	 	
	 	
2009-08-11  1.3.2.beta
	Fixed bug with "uri" parameter: http://mmisw.org/ont?form=n3&uri=http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/device
	     is returning the *versioned* form (of the latest version) -- Should be the unversioned form.
	Fix: UriResolver2.serviceForOntology(Request):
			// no explicit version requested and it's an unversioned MmiUri?
			if ( req.version == null && req.mmiUri != null && req.mmiUri.getVersion() == null ) {
				model = UnversionedConverter.getUnversionedModel(originalModel, req.mmiUri);
			}
			
	
2009-08-08,10   1.3.1.beta
	Dispatching "version" parameter in conjunction with "uri" parameter
		- Example: http://localhost:8080/ont?form=owl&uri=http://EXAMPLE.org/external3&version=20090806T021338
		- OntServlet: accept "version" parameter; see _dispatchUri(Request req).
		
	FIXME: Overall usage of MmiUri as a way to determine that the URI corresponds
	to a *hosted* (ie., with namespace in the context of this web service), is NOT sufficient.
	In particular, MmiUri constructors do not check the actual value of the hostname-root
	combination, so, any external URI that happens to follow the MmiUri structure will be
	considered to be a *hosted* one.


2009-08-03
	- OntServlet.getRegisteredOntology(String potentialOntUri) -> Ontology
	  method to obtain a registered ontology considering the various cases: versioned
	  and unversioned MmiUri, and other URI. 
	  This is used when dispatching the "uri" parameter (_dispatchUri).
	
	
2009-08-01,03:   1.3.0.beta (was 1.2.3.beta)
	- Added build and configuration params to allow deployment of the service on any machine (while
	  removing several related hard-coded pieces, in particular about http://mmisw.org...):
		appserver.host
		portal.service.url
		 

2009-07-31  
	1.2.3.beta
	- OntServlet: check if requested uri (via "uri" param) corresponds to whole ontology; if so, dispatch it.
	  Use ontology member in req and make sure the Uri attribute is set.
	- UriResolver2: redirect to ''portal#uri'' (instead of ''ontmd?ontoloyUri=uri'')

2009-07-27:
	Re-hosting:
		- OntGraph._doInitModel: catching URISyntaxException while getting the MmmiUri object
		  as an indicador of re-hosted ontology.
		  NOTE: this is just a preliminary mechanism.
		  
		- MiscDispatcher.listAll: include non-compliant MmiUri ontologies to provide for
		  re-hosted ones.
		  
	- OntServlet now dispatchs the "uri" parameter such that it can dispatch a re-hosted ontology.
		
		
2009-06-17                              
        - fix for issue #150: "file extension is lost in $ request"
          UriResolver: append the extension for the URI used in the redicrection.
          Note the MmiUri.getTermUri() --same for MmiUri.getOntologyUri()-- does not include the extension.

2009-06-09
	- DotGenerator and .dot response: just added parameter 'il' for "includeLegend"
	
	
2009-06-03 -  version 1.2.2.beta
	- UnversionedConverter: Disabled the alteration of attribute values, so the contents 
	  of the unversioned ontology will be exactly as that of the versioned ontology.
	  TODO: we still need to determine the mechanism to explicitly indicate that the 
	  "unversioned" response is an unversioned form of the corresponding latest version.
	  
2009-05-31
	- listall: include o.ontology_id

2009-05-24
	- listall: order by o.ontology_id, o.version_number.  The ontology URIs are shown in
	  versioned form.
	
2009-05-23
	- Omv: added: usedOntologyEngineeringTool
	- OmvMmi: added: voc2rdf, vine
	
	  
2009-05-22
	MisDispatcher: include username in listall response.
	
2009-05-21
	- DotGenerator now ignores owl:Thing to reduce cluttering the diagram
	- New DotGeneratorProgram with a main program to exercise DotGenerator.
	
2009-05-20
	- DotGenerator: no dependency on base URI--always use local name of RDFNode
	  TODO: handle (potentially) different namespaces.
	  
2009-05-14
	- MiscDispatcher.listForPortal: List all entries for use by the iserver

2009-05-13
	- UriResolver2: resolving HTML by redirecting to OntMd service
	
	- MiscDispatcher.resolveGetCsv: resolve unversioned request
	
2009-05-12
	Refactoring:
	- new OntServlet as main entry point and as a preparation to start refactoring of UriResolver
	- new UriResolver2 as a support for the incremental refactoring
	- UriResolver2: preliminary dispatch;
	- OntServlet: calls uriResolver2 (and not uriResolver) if special developer parameter "ur2" is included in the request.
	
2009-05-11
	- Added config property: aquaportal.voc2rdf.dir
	- Added internal operation _csv to provide the CSV contents of an ontology
	- TODO remove the "_lpath" operation in "Ont"
	
	
2009-05-08
	- if the "uri" parameter is included, resolve by the given URI, which is done 
	  via a SPARQL query that depends on the "form" parameter. If form is "html" 
	  or "csv" a SELECT query, otherwise, for "owl", "rdf", "n3", a CONSTRUCT query.
	  The sparql dispatcher has been updated to handle these possible formats.
	  
	- dispatch form=json for SELECT SPARQL query.
	
2009-05-07
	- MmiUri(String): prevent NPE when there is no path in the URI
	
2009-04-29:
	- Some refactorings/clean-up:
		- new RegularFileDispatcher
		- moved some misc operations into a new MiscDispatcher
		- preliminary code for dispatching an image request
		
2009-04-07:
	- Fix of issue #123: "encoded URI not properly handled" (MmiUri, MmiUriTest)

2009-04-01
	- HtmlDispacher.appendHtmlIfResolvableByThisService is now the way to properly
	  prepare refered resources that are resolvable by the service (so they are links 
	  to the HTML format as well).
	  
	- code clean-up: moved some special dispatchs from _resolveUri.
	
	
2009-03-27
	- UriResolver: some doc updates and minor code re-arrangements (no changes in logic)
	
	- JenaUtil2: some pending renamings done:
		getURIForBase --> removeTrailingFragment
		getURIForNS   --> appendFragment
	
	- Sparql: enabled DESCRIBE responses.
	
	- Fixed 100: "term URI always resolved in HTML"
		- TermExtractor: extracts a model with information about the requested entity.
		- UriResolver._resolveUriOntFormat: serialized resulting model in the requested format. 
	
2009-03-21
	- Just comment about Omv.acronym saying that is about "resourceType" not "shortName"
       
	 
2009-03-19:   (1.0.0.beta)
	- Issue 8: "Improve HTML response"
	  Added a header with logo and links to semanticframework

2009-03-17:   (0.2.0.beta7)
	- Code clean-up:
		- Removed unused types: MdDispatcher, MdHelper, AttrGroup, AttrDef.
		  Medatada is handled in "ontmd" project. See 2008-11-14 comment below.
		
		
		
2009-03-16:
	- Fixed Issue 102: "searches should be against the "unversioned" form of the latest ontologies"
 	  See OntGraph.
 	  NOTE: *only* the "unversioned" latest versions are loaded into the graph so all
	  responses will be now in unversioned form.
	  Fix available as of 0.2.0.beta6
	  
	- Sparql: make links for good URLs in html response. The ones that are good MmiUri's are
	  appended ".html" so the HTML output format is transferred for subsequent resolution.
	  This fixes Issue 103: "make links for well formed URLs in HTML query reponse"
 	  

2009-03-15:
	- Fixed issue 101: "Inexistent term is resolved"
	  The "problem" was that model.getResource "behaves identically to createResource(String)"
	  so it *creates* a fresh resource if the resource does NOT exist!
	  See http://jena.sourceforge.net/javadoc/com/hp/hpl/jena/rdf/model/Model.html#getResource(java.lang.String)
	  I was using the call ``termRes = model.getResource(termUri)'', along with a termRes != null check to 
	  determine the existence of the term. The fix is to use an explicit "contains" check.
	  Also removed the try with the "#" separator as we are now only using "/".
	  A 404 is returned now as well.
	  This is fixed in HtmlDispatcher.dispatchTerm() which is currently the only place where
	  term URIs are being resolved.  See issue #100: "term URI always resolved in HTML"
	  
	- Sparql: Unused prefixes (except "") are now removed from the CONSTRUCT output.
	  New JenaUtil2.removeUnusedNsPrefixes(Model model);
	  
	  
	- New version.properties to handle version information for this service. build.xml translates
	  this to the application via the web.xml (which is read by OntConfig). Also, a "build number",
	  which is a timestamp, is used for the full version. 
	  
	  
2009-03-14:
	- The following kind URI was accepted as valid:
	       http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/badversion/someVocab/someTerm
	  Fixed.  See MmiUri public constructor and MmiUriTest.testVersionInvalid2().
	  
	  
	- Completed review of MmiUri and simplification of constructor and operations.
	  In particular, the "extension" concept has been re-worked; now, the extension is
	  provided by getExtension() (instead of getTopicExtension(), which has been removed).
	  This extension can be specified in the topic component (as before) but also in the
	  term component, for example:
	      http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/someVocab/someTerm.owl
	  But now, the extension is NOT included in any of the query operations, except, of course
	  getExtension() itself. In general, the extension is to be used just as a way to help determine
	  the output format desired by the requester. 
	  Note also that the ontology URIs are never stored in the database with any extension.
	  
	- Fixed issue #51: "Fix unversioned HTML to be unversioned".
	
	
2009-03-13:
	- working on issue 51: "Fix unversioned HTML to be unversioned", in concrete the problem
	  I described in today's comment.
	
	
2009-03-03
	Resuming work on issue 62: unversioned terms not resolving 
	http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=62&sort=priority
	
	- adding some more log information
	- MmiUri.getOntologyUri() was not honoring its documentation that says only the
	  URI for the ontology is returned (not including the term, if any). However, this was
	  not proporly guaranteed. Fixed.
	
	
2008-12-29   0.2.0.beta3 (20081229)
	- sparql: "select" query now also process new "form" parameter, which can be
	  "html" (the default) or csv.
	- updated sparql.html page.
	
	- dispatch new commands: vocabs, mappings.  
	  Parameter "uv" can be used to get both unversioned and versioned URIs: uv=true.  
	  By default, only unversioned URIs are returned.
	  display_label included in output

2008-12-03   0.2.0.beta2 (20081203)
	- Dispatch the "root" request to report information about this service, ie.
	      http://mmisw.org/ont/
	  now reports something like:
	  
				  MMI Ontology URI Resolver
			This service is part of the MMI Semantic Framework
			
			MMI Ontology URI Resolver. Version 0.2.0.beta2 (20081203)

	  instead of returning 404.
	
	
2008-11-18   0.2.0.beta2 (20081118)
	- 62: default URL not resolving 
	Db.getOntologyVersions: the term component in the given URI is ignored.
	
	
2008-11-14  0.2.0.beta (20081114)
	
	- Issue 53: unversioned reponse wrong for "slash" ontologies 
	UnversionedConverter: Using JenaUtil2 to handle the fragments as in OntMd
	(TODO JenaUtil2.java is a copy of the same file on ontmd -> unify in a libray)
	
	
	- resolve term in html:  First, try with / separator; then with #
	  Note: jena resolves a request with #, even if everything in the ontology
	  is defined in terms of the slash. Then, since the tries were #-then-/ before,
	  the # resolution was OK but made the rest of the dispatch unable to find
	  statametes associated with the term.  With the new order /-then-#, this
	  is now correct.
	
	- Deprecating MdDispatcher - MD display no longer done here (use ontmd instead)
	TODO: See if MdHelper can also be deprecated/removed when doing code clean-up
	
	
2008-11-13  0.2.0.beta (20081113)
	- preliminary tests of unversioned response seem OK
	  Issue 24, part 2): http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=24
	  
	  
2008-11-12
	- Starting "unversioned" version request dispatch
	
	
	
2008-11-11   (Happy B-day Ini!)
	- MmiUri.LATEST_VERSION_INDICATOR = "$"
	
	- Issue 27: URIs have # signs instead of / before terms:
		All URIs starting with http://mmisw.org/ont/ will get the "#" (if any) 
		replaced by "/".   I think this works pretty well, I mean, not only as a 
		temporary solution, but also that it won't hurt once the submitted ontologies
		get the namespace with the "/" fragment separator.
	

2008-11-10
	- Rule added: (a.2) an OWL document if is the user-agent is "Java/*"
		This is a workaround for the following situation in VINE:
		The underlying Jena library should include the accept element:
		"application/rdf+xml" but it's not doing so, see bug:
		   Wrong Accept-Header in HTTP-Connections - ID: 1424091
		   http://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?func=detail&aid=1424091&group_id=40417&atid=430288
	
	
2008-11-04
	Re. 24: unversioned and latest-version requests
		- Accept dash ('-') as a valid version in an ontology URI request.
		- The dash requst is handled with a "redirect" to the actual latest version
		- the "unversioned" request is still handled as usual: it simple returns the
		  contents of the latest version without any modification.
	
	
2008-11-03
	- _getFullPath: try with or without ".owl" extension
	
2008-11-02
	- UriResolver: now reportin PC-Remote-Addr; also googlebot check disabled as the
	  the robots.txt is now active.
	
	- Db: log.warn instead of throwing the exception in the _con.close() call (sometimes
	  an "already closed" exception is thrown --perhaps some pooling/cache thing-- but 
	  showing the error to the end-user is not necessary)
	
	
2008-11-01
	- New Db.getOntologyVersions(MmiUri mmiUri) to get the versions of a given
	  ontology. The given mmiUri is used to create the query wildcard, ie, the 
	  version part (mmiUri.getVersion()) is ignored.
	  
	- Issue 23: Resolve latest version
	  See UriResolver._resolveUri:
	  	If version is not explicitly requested, find the latest version of the
	  	corresponding ontology (using "%" for version wildcard and the other components
	  	in the URI), and continue regular processing with the URI found.
	  	Note: topic extension is handled with a trailing ".%" to the base topic without
	  	extension. Note: the dot is important to avoid getting topics that have the topic 
	  	in question as suffix.
	  	
	  
	- Convenience parameter "_versions" to report the versions of a requested mmiUri, ex:
	    http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/parameter/?_versions
	
	
2008-10-30
	 - Issue 14: "mysql db connection timeout error"
	   http://code.google.com/p/mmisw/issues/detail?id=14
	   
	   Db.java: move DataSource lookup to the init() method.
	   Ref: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/bestpractices/using_httpservlet_method.html
	   TODO: still need to see if this helps solve the issue.
	   
	   Also, closing all connections after they are used.
	   
	 - Not resolving request with extension (eg., .../topic.html) when the original URI
	   in the db is with no extension (eg, .../topic). -- Fixed.
	   
	 - Now using pattern: ^yyyy[mm[dd][Thh[mm[ss]]]$ to validate a non-null version string
	   in the ontology URI.
	   
	 
2008-10-29
	- show requested URI, remote host, and user-agent 
	- return no-content to googlebot
	
	
2008-10-24
	build.xml: added "voc-jar" target to create org.mmisw.ont.vocabulary.jar to facilitate
	the current updates in the voc2rdf project.
	(note: these vocabularies could be located in an independed project).
	
2008-10-23
	Paul:  Carlos, got an update: we're now using your table formatting, including CSS, on the
	metadata table when we show ontologies. If you could change your output again (sorry) to 
	only put out the contents of the table (starting with <tr> instead of <table>) then I 
	think it will become seamless.
	
	--> done.
	

2008-10-22
	- HTML output improved a bit. New class HtmlDispatcher.
	- doPost was calling super.doGet!! (a typo).  Fixed.
	- Sparql "select" response now in HTML.
	- Util.{toHtml,toHtmlComment}() added to avoid inserted code
	  in html responses.
	  TODO: use in ALL html output.
	
	
2008-10-21
	- Starting handling of metadata vocabularies.
	- New package package org.mmisw.ont.vocabulary:
	     Omv: Vocabulary definitions for Omv
	     OmvMmi: Vocabulary definitions for OmvMmi
	  The definition are based on the current contents of:
	     http://marinemetadata.org/files/mmi/OntologyExampleOMV.owl
	  which I saved in the same package for reference.
	  
	- Dispatching the metadata:
		"_md" parameter used to display the metadata, example:
		     http://mmisw.org/ont/foo/mytopic.owl?_md
		(I added some of the new attributes in mytopic.owl for testing).
	  Main classes:
		MdDispatcher: Dispatches the metadata output
		MdHelper: Handles the metadata attributes.
	
	
2008-10-20
	- MmmUri: fixed getTermUri();  new getTopicExtension().
	
	- First implementation of the current Dereferencing rules, but unfinished.
	- Accept: A helper class to query the "accept" header values.
	- "form" parameter also handled. If given, this parameter takes precedence
	  over the file extension.
	  
	- parameter "info" changed to "_debug"
	
	
	
2008-10-19
	- new convenience annotation @org.mmisw.ont.util.Unfinished
	- sparql stuff moved to package org.mmisw.ont.sparql
	- package-info.java files added
	
	- sparql queries now working
	- "construct" and "select" queries accepted and processed.
	- WebContent/sparql.html - tests page
	
	
2008-10-18  v. 0.1.1 (20081018)
	- General code clean-up (loggers, non "static" classes)
	- New OntConfig to handle configuration parameters; removed hard-coded params.
	
2008-10-17
	- main.css: normal font (instead of x-small)
	- minor logging changes
	
	
2008-10-16
	- Preliminaries for resolving terms
	
	- Process xslt for output of sparql query (with xslt parameter)
	- Inline stylesheet with xslti parameter, but not working yet (in firefox at least)
	 

2008-10-15
	- OntGraph: load all ontologies into memory
	- Added sparql support: .../ont?sparql=CONSTRUCT  { ?s ?p ?o } where{?s ?p ?o. } LIMIT 20
	  TODO testing
	- Internal request to reload ontologies: .../ont?_reload
	  TODO (perhaps): set up quantum (cronjob) to do the reload 
	  
	- Db.getOntologies: Fixed link to obtaing ontologies:
	  The correct link between the two tables is:
	    v_ncbo_ontology.id  ==  ncbo_ontology_file.ontology_version_id
	
	
2008-10-13
	- added "list" parameter: shows the list of ontologies as a convenience for
	  testing the existing entries in the database.
	  
	  Note that all these convenience parameters shouldn't be visible for the
	  general user.
	  
	- added logging mechanism.
	  
	
2008-10-12
	- Initial version 0.1.0
	- NOTE: <version> component not yet handled.
	
	Note: mysql driver not included in the project nor in the generated war.
	Instead, this application assumes the driver to be available in the container.
	(I saved it under <apache-tomcat-home>/lib/ on mmi).

org.mmisw.ont - Ontology URI resolver 
Carlos Rueda - MMI / MBARI

ChangeLog

2008-10-23
	Paul:  Carlos, got an update: we're now using your table formatting, including CSS, on the
	metadata table when we show ontologies. If you could change your output again (sorry) to 
	only put out the contents of the table (starting with <tr> instead of <table>) then I 
	think it will become seamless.
	
	--> done.
	

2008-10-22
	- HTML output improved a bit. New class HtmlDispatcher.
	- doPost was calling super.doGet!! (a typo).  Fixed.
	- Sparql "select" response now in HTML.
	- Util.{toHtml,toHtmlComment}() added to avoid inserted code
	  in html responses.
	  TODO: use in ALL html output.
	
	
2008-10-21
	- Starting handling of metadata vocabularies.
	- New package package org.mmisw.ont.vocabulary:
	     Omv: Vocabulary definitions for Omv
	     OmvMmi: Vocabulary definitions for OmvMmi
	  The definition are based on the current contents of:
	     http://marinemetadata.org/files/mmi/OntologyExampleOMV.owl
	  which I saved in the same package for reference.
	  
	- Dispatching the metadata:
		"_md" parameter used to display the metadata, example:
		     http://mmisw.org/ont/foo/mytopic.owl?_md
		(I added some of the new attributes in mytopic.owl for testing).
	  Main classes:
		MdDispatcher: Dispatches the metadata output
		MdHelper: Handles the metadata attributes.

	- MmmUri: fixed getTermUri();  new getTopicExtension().
	
	- First implementation of the current Dereferencing rules, but unfinished.
	- Accept: A helper class to query the "accept" header values.
	- "form" parameter also handled. If given, this parameter takes precedence
	  over the file extension.
	  
	- parameter "info" changed to "_debug"
	
	
	
2008-10-19
	- new convenience annotation @org.mmisw.ont.util.Unfinished
	- sparql stuff moved to package org.mmisw.ont.sparql
	- package-info.java files added
	
	- sparql queries now working
	- "construct" and "select" queries accepted and processed.
	- WebContent/sparql.html - tests page
	
	
2008-10-18  v. 0.1.1 (20081018)
	- General code clean-up (loggers, non "static" classes)
	- New OntConfig to handle configuration parameters; removed hard-coded params.
	
2008-10-17
	- main.css: normal font (instead of x-small)
	- minor logging changes
	
	
2008-10-16
	- Preliminaries for resolving terms
	
	- Process xslt for output of sparql query (with xslt parameter)
	- Inline stylesheet with xslti parameter, but not working yet (in firefox at least)
	 

2008-10-15
	- OntGraph: load all ontologies into memory
	- Added sparql support: .../ont?sparql=CONSTRUCT  { ?s ?p ?o } where{?s ?p ?o. } LIMIT 20
	  TODO testing
	- Internal request to reload ontologies: .../ont?_reload
	  TODO (perhaps): set up quantum (cronjob) to do the reload 
	  
	- Db.getOntologies: Fixed link to obtaing ontologies:
	  The correct link between the two tables is:
	    v_ncbo_ontology.id  ==  ncbo_ontology_file.ontology_version_id
	
	
2008-10-13
	- added "list" parameter: shows the list of ontologies as a convenience for
	  testing the existing entries in the database.
	  
	  Note that all these convenience parameters shouldn't be visible for the
	  general user.
	  
	- added logging mechanism.
	  
	
2008-10-12
	- Initial version 0.1.0
	- NOTE: <version> component not yet handled.
	
	Note: mysql driver not included in the project nor in the generated war.
	Instead, this application assumes the driver to be available in the container.
	(I saved it under <apache-tomcat-home>/lib/ on mmi).
